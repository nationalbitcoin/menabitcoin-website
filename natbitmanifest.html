							<p>However, in academic circles, in state, macroeconomic, and monetary policy over the past decades, views of unification (essentially ultra-globalization) have dominated. A unipolar world order and an oligopoly in the global media have hindered the free political expression of people around the world. Unique cultures and entire civilizations risk disappearing. In the heat of the struggle for "diversity" based on skin color, sexual preferences, and genders, real human diversity is dying under the pressure of a global standard. The value crisis is already turning into negative economic consequences. As a result of global labor division, supply chains have become too fragile. Deficits and price increases are becoming increasingly difficult to blame on the pandemic. Despite the efforts of ultra-globalists, centrifugal sentiments are growing in the United States and the European Union. Other countries may follow the same path.</p>

Bank deposits and money market instruments do not protect against inflation; people are forced to take risks on the stock market. Transactions are monitored everywhere, and the questionable legality of this accumulates public irritation; your fiat money can be "frozen" or confiscated at any time. Payments cannot be made remotely without the intervention of intermediaries who themselves decide which transactions to conduct and which not to. Commission fees are very high.</p>

							<p>Even now, with a significant degree of globalization, the bulk of economic activity by ordinary people is local or national in character. Most people rarely make payments abroad or receive money from overseas. People mainly earn in local enterprises and buy goods in local retail. By and large, the idea of global money is abstract for them.</p>

							<p>Any sane government will not blindly accept global means of payment within its country, and patriotically-minded elites will be unambiguously hostile to it. Bitcoin cannot be an exception; it too is perceived as a threat. In all countries, authorities are particularly wary of cross-border private payments, as they can finance anti-government activities, terrorism, and crime.</p>

							<p>But it is not the criminal world that concerns the authorities most in this regard, but rather the fact that global Bitcoin is convenient for ultra-globalists seeking an extreme form of cultural and economic unification that does not envisage a significant role for national states in the future. In the confrontation between sovereign states and the growing influence of transnational corporations, the former suffer enormous losses. Their officials are bribed. Their citizens are imposed with alien worldviews. They are monitored online. Retailers, social networks, and other IT giants openly plan to introduce their own monetary surrogates, which will deprive all countries of some tax revenue.</p>

								<strong><em>The presence of borders is a benefit. Competition between countries is vital.</em></strong>
							</h4>
							<p>This is a proven, natural mechanism that has worked well throughout all epochs. A state that eliminates competition within itself can drive its citizens into poverty. However, on the international stage, it still represents value by stimulating other countries. The Soviet Union is a prime example. The introduction of an eight-hour workday, recognition of women's rights, the development of atomic energy, the conquest of space, and much more in the West are largely due to the Soviet Union's efforts. And after the collapse of the socialist camp, the union of democratic states began to degenerate rapidly.</p>

The meaning of cultural diversity includes the ability to compare oneself with other people, and therefore, the ability to look at oneself objectively. The dominance of global cultural clichés may have seemed harmless a few decades ago, but today, it has already manifested itself in completely grotesque forms.</p>

							<p>Formally, within national borders, the state has no financial constraints on expenditures if there is a justification for printing money. An unconditional exchange of National Bitcoins by citizens for local fiat currency is an <strong> excellent reason for additional issuance</strong>,, increasing GDP and domestic demand. Targeted financing can be conveniently carried out through National Bitcoins, and the movement of budget funds can be tracked, and "helicopter money" can be distributed.</p>

							<p><strong>National Bitcoin can stimulate foreign demand for domestic products.</strong> To do this, the government guarantees the redemption of National Bitcoins from local businesses. Their management, knowing that National Bitcoins are already in the hands of foreigners, conducts marketing activities in the corresponding markets. Thus, the state stimulates production and expands the access of domestic enterprises to foreign markets. Authorities who learn to apply the National Bitcoin toolkit will increase their influence. People and businesses will also benefit.</p>

							<p> <strong>To support domestic demand,</strong> National Bitcoins can be distributed in the form of discounts and cashbacks. National Bitcoins are a convenient digital currency, ideal for the consumer sector. The ordinary fiduciary national currency will not suffer: dual-circuit monetary systems <a href="https://crystalbook.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/growth-crystal-ENG.pdf" target="_blank">have proven</a> their effectiveness.

							<p>The undeniable advantage of local complementary currencies in times of crisis undermines the authority of central power, which is dangerous. For example, in conditions of crisis and unemployment during the Great Depression, the complementary currency of the Austrian town of Wörgl revived production and domestic demand, while the rest of the continent continued to sink into economic chaos. The "Miracle of Wörgl" inspired six neighboring towns to copy its monetary system, and Eduard Daladier (Prime Minister of France) even visited there to see the currency in action. It was precisely the resounding success of the experiment and the fact that more than two hundred neighboring towns were already preparing to reproduce it that led to the currency of Wörgl being declared illegal. It should be noted that the immediate return of social despair and economic depression served as a breeding ground for the emergence of Nazism.</p>

							<p>It is worth considering the modern experience of the credit system of the Swiss business cooperative WIR, which has remained in harmony with the authorities for decades (since 1934). WIR operates as a commercial credit union through which tens of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises can access financing in the form of WIR francs at an interest rate of less than 1%. This currency, issued in the form of loans, CANNOT BE CONVERTED into regular money or devalued. Stodder and Lietaer's research (2016) shows that this system has a stabilizing effect on macroeconomic cycles. During periods of economic boom, small businesses usually prefer bank loans, while in periods of decline when bank interest rates rise, they turn to WIR loans. There are other similar successful examples such as IRTA, Sardex, RES, PuntoTRANSacciones, Banco Palmas, Bangla-Pesa.</p>

								So, <strong>the rule is as follows: it is necessary to avoid conversion.</strong>.
							</h4>
							<p>Conversion (currency exchange) is not a strict necessity. Although among enthusiasts of community and territorial currencies there are always many dreamers seeking to overcome poverty and deprivation and who are critical of earning money for its own sake, the main reason for turning to National Bitcoins will be an economic shock on the demand side, leading to low turnover and unemployment. Therefore, first of all, participants in the system need to buy goods from each other, within the territory.</p>

							<p>Price stability is a key factor in economic development. Price jumps prevent people from seeing real market signals and supporting efficient resource allocation. While smooth changes do not hinder economic vision, suddenness and volatility <a href="https://mises.org/wire/price-stability-really-good-thing" target="_blank">worsen the situation.</a>
